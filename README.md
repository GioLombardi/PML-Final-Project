# PML Final Project Repository

This repository contains the code and data for the PML Final Project by Elizaveta Ignatova, Nicola Bertoni and Giovanni Lombardi (Group 04).

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**
  - Contains all Jupyter Notebook files with solutions to the exercises.
- **`data/`**
  - Stores pickle and .pth files containing the trained parameters of the models.
- **`README.md`**
  - Provides an overview, instructions, and important information about the repository.

## Running the Notebooks

You can run the notebooks directly on Google Colab without any local setup.

### **Open in Colab**

### **Manual Access**

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on **"File"** > **"Open notebook"**.
3. Select the **"GitHub"** tab.
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/GioLombardi/PML-Final-Project`.
5. Choose the notebook you wish to open and click **"Open"**.

## Notes

- **Execution Environment:** All code was developed and executed using Google Colab.

- **Dependencies:** The necessary Python packages are installed directly within the notebooks using `pip`. Ensure that you run all cells in the notebooks to install any required dependencies before executing the main code.

- **Repository Structure:** Maintaining the directory structure (`/notebooks` and `/data`) is crucial for the seamless loading of data files within the notebooks.
