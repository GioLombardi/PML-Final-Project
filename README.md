## Notes

- **Execution Environment:** All code was developed and executed using Google Colab, leveraging its computational resources and ease of sharing.

- **Dependencies:** The necessary Python packages are installed directly within the notebooks using `pip`. Ensure that you run all cells in the notebooks to install any required dependencies before executing the main code.

- **Repository Structure:** Maintaining the directory structure (`/notebooks` and `/data`) is crucial for the seamless loading of data files within the notebooks.
