### **Manual Access**

If you prefer to access the Colab notebooks manually, please follow these steps:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on **"File"** > **"Open notebook"**.
3. Select the **"GitHub"** tab.
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/GioLombardi/PML-Final-Project`.
5. Choose the notebook you wish to open and click **"Open"**.

## Notes

- **Execution Environment:** All code was developed and executed using Google Colab.

- **Dependencies:** The necessary Python packages are installed directly within the notebooks using `pip`. Ensure that you run all cells in the notebooks to install any required dependencies before executing the main code.

- **Repository Structure:** Maintaining the directory structure (`/notebooks` and `/data`) is crucial for the seamless loading of data files within the notebooks.
